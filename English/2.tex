\subsection{Task C}
The bar chart illustrates the main reasons for using social media in October 2024. The most significant reason is keeping in touch with friends and family, with 51.5 of respondents citing this.  Following this, 39 of users stated that they use social media to fill spare time, ranking it as the second most popular reason.  Reading news stories and finding content such as articles and videos are also notable reasons, accounting for 34.4 and 30.4 respectively.  In contrast, a smaller percentage of users, specifically 26.9, utilize social media for finding products to purchase. Overall, the data suggests that social media is primarily used for communication, information consumption, and leisure rather than shopping.

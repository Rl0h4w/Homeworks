\subsection{Task A}
Dear Customer Support,

I \textbf{am writing} to \textbf{complain} about a tablet I purchased from your site two weeks ago. The description said it’s durable and has a long lifespan, but it stopped charging after just five days. I \textbf{inspected} it carefully and couldn’t understand what is wrong.

Since it’s faulty and still under \textbf{its warranty}, I would like a \textbf{replacement} or another solution ASAP. If you send me a \textbf{replacement}, make sure it’s inspected before you send it so it doesn’t break again. Can you tell me \textbf{how long it takes} to process this? This issue has caused considerable inconvenience, so I’d really appreciate a quick decision \textbf{regarding this problem}.

Thanks a lot for your help.

Cheers,
Jane Doe
